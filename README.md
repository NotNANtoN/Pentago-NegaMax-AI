# Pentago-NegaMax-AI
This is a small project of mine that I worked on during the summer break. 
Intrigued by this game, a friend of mine and me decided to try to create programs that are able to play Pentago, to see who can create the stronger program.
Unfortunately my friend has not finished his program.
The game of Pentago is explained here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentago
I wrote this program in C, as I was most comfortable in that language at that time.

My algorithm is a variation of the negamax algorithm, which is a variation of the minimax algorithm. I use a trie to store game states, iterative deepening in which I search the best moves of the last iterations first and an extensive scoring function.
