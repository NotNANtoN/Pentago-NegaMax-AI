To do:

Priorit√§t:
	1.testing environment
	2.beta cuts
	3.aspiration windows
	4.better ordering


-add testing environment
	-test cases
	-look up perfect solutions for test cases
	-timer for test cases
	-score tests( according to correctness of the move and time taken to calculate the move)
	-implement test cases

-aspiration windows
	- are they useful?
	-why does a window of 20 lead to seg faults?
-beta cuts
	-inside or outside of alpha if statement
-improve move ordering
	-add several best moves to be searched first


Done:

Fixed:
-fix segmentation faults! ( See test case 1)
	test case 1:
011211
